# Web Lab &ndash; HTML Forms
In this lab, we conclude our HTML coverage by looking at HTML forms. These allow you to submit data to a server for processing.

## Obtaining the code
Now that you've obtained a copy of this repository through GitHub Classroom's invite, you have your own private version of this repository (i.e. the one you're looking at now)! To clone this repository onto your machine, click the green `Code` button, make sure `HTTPS` is selected, then click the `copy` button to the right of the web URL to copy its value. Then, clone onto your local machine from a terminal, using the `git clone` command.

If this is the first time you've ever cloned a repository on the current machine, you may be asked to enter your GitHub credentials. The "sign in with your browser" option should work just fine. You may need to enter your GitHub username and password, and / or authorize "git credential manager" to access your account. Perform these steps if asked.

Now, you should have a clone of your repository on your local machine, ready to develop!

Remember to commit and push your work regularly for backup purposes.

Explore the files in the project, familiarizing yourself with the content. Open the project in Visual Studio Code by right-clicking the lab folder and selecting *"Open with Code"* (or, if this option is not available, you may open VS code and select *"File"* âž¡ *"Open Folder"*).


## Exercise One &ndash; Constructing and submitting a form
Open [`form.html`](./exercises/ex01/form.html), located in the [`ex01`](./exercises/ex01) folder. Create a `<form>` in that HTML file, like the one in this screenshot:

![](./spec/ex01-screenshot.png)

Ensure you give sensible names and values to all of the inputs. Then, add the submit button (labelled *"Done!"* in the screenshot) and the reset button, labelled *"Clear"*.

Finally, modify your HTML so that when the *"Submit"* button is pressed, the data is submitted to the application located at the <https://echo.trex-sandwich.com> address.

Preview your form and try submitting it.
- What is shown to you after submitting the page?
- What happens if you change the method of of your form?

Type your answers to the above questions in the space below.

## Exercise Two &ndash; More form controls
Continuing on from Exercise One, add further form controls and other elements to your HTML page so that the completed form looks like the one in this screenshot:

![](./spec/ex02-screenshot.png)

Again, make sure to give sensible names and values to the inputs. Make sure you test your modified form by submitting to the same URL as in Exercise Thirteen.
