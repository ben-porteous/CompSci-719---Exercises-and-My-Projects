            <h2>Examples Using .forEach, .map, .filter and .reduce:</h2>
            <p>All of these first examples should be able to be run already; please run these examples and examine the
                code so that you understand the sort of functionality you'll be completing in the tasks.</p>
            <p>Please make sure to look at the use of the .map, .filter and .reduce array iterator methods specifically
                so that you understand how they can be used to filter, change and summarise data that is stored within
                arrays of JavaScript objects.</p>

            <h2>Tasks for you to complete:</h2>
            <p>These three options below that are related to book ratings require you to complete the contents of the
                related JavaScript functions in order to work properly.</p>
            <p>Make sure to read the instructions in the handout carefully and the relevant comments in the JavaScript
                code. You should also spend some time examining the examples first as they are structurally very similar
                to the code you will implement.</p>
