Poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree being gorgeous with belly side up miaow then turn around and show you my bum. In the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep ask for petting for flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. </p>
