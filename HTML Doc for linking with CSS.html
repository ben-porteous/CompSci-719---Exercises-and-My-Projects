        I is not fat, i is fluffy spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day and catch small lizards, bring them into house, then unable to find them on carpet so under the bed. Poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree being gorgeous with belly side up miaow then turn around and show you my bum. In the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep ask for petting for flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. </p>
